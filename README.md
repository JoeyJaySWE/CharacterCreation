# Character Creation (W.I.P)

## Description
During my final year as Web dev student at YRGO I made my master in the form of a Character Creation process for the the international
Table top RPG guild <em>Vengeful Scars</em>. One of the main issues with Classic Table Top is the main feature of the concept, the Character Sheet.
A piece of paper contain all data of your chracter. Name, age, stats, item, skills, feat, height, width, carry weight, etc. To a new player,
this easily gets confusing and scaring as they stair down at numerous of to them unkown fields that needs to be filled out before they can play.

<strong>Issue</strong>
The Chracter Creation sheet is way to complex, confusing and intimidating for new players. Making many potential newcommerce run away.

<strong>Solution</strong>
A less is more aproach in the way of clear and clutter free Character Creation Process more like the ones you can find in modern days videogames like Fallout or Dungeons and Dragons Online, Star Wars Knights of The Old Republic.
