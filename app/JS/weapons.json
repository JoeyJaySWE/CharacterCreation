The saber can cut through most materials (except another lightsaber blade, an energy shield, or a few exotic materials), given enough time. Because only the hand grip has any weight, unskilled users have difficulty judging the position of the blade. The lightsaber’s true potential becomes apparent in the hands of a fully trained Jedi, who can defend and attack with the weapon, deflecting shots or striking opponents with the glowing blade. A lightsaber requires a special energy cell to operate (the cost is ten times the price of an ordinary energy cell, but it lasts almost indefinitely). The weapons are extremely rare artifacts — they are very rarely found for sale and possession of a lightsaber was highly illegal in the Empire.",

The heavy repeating blaster operates only in autofire mode. If you use a heavy repeating blaster without a tripod or other mount, you cannot brace the weapon and suffer a 1D penalty to your skill roll. A heavy repeating blaster requires a power pack to operate. After 20 shots, the power pack must be replaced. This weapon can also be attached to a power generator for longer use. (see E-Web Repeating Blaster on opposite column for power generator rules)",

Longer delays require specialized timers. Explosive charges are highly restricted, usually only available to military or law enforcement specialists or specialized construction units. Han Solo and his strike team used proton grenade explosive charges to take out the shield generator on Endor in Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. An explosive charge delivers a lot of destructive energy to  specific point, making it perfect for demolishing structures or clearing rubble. It causes negligible damage beyond its burst radius. Of course, collateral damage and subsequent explosions usually accompany the use of an explosive charge.",
